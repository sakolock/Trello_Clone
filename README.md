# Trello_Clone
In Progress Trello Clone. Most HTML/CSS from Trello, functionality mine.

The focus was to build a single-user clone of Trello implementing their functionality through Backbone.js.
In most cases I took existing HTML/CSS from Trello's site in order to focus on the JS functionality. Some HTML/CSS is mine,
some will be refactored further to better align with the lightweight clone I am working toward.

Currently there are several functionalities not fully implemented, most notable those that involve updating cards through lists
